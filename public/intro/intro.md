### What is DappReader
**DappReader is a product we are proud to offer, a free tool for developers in the EVM ecosystem.**

DappReader is designed to provide developers with the management of published multi-chain contracts and fast front-end-contract debugging. This tool will help developers to develop, test and deploy contract projects more efficiently, and improve the quality and efficiency of project development.

You can simply understand it as the Postman of web2 era !

### Do you have the same problem:
Using tools such as Remix and Etherscan.io to handle existing contracts or debug new contracts is very unfriendly and requires frequent code updates and validation.

Writing contracts and forgetting where they are after a long time, and having to dig through interaction logs to find them.

Remote collaboration with team members or other Front-End Engineers is also cumbersome.

In addition, making smart contracts available to non-developers requires writing complex UI and deploying it to a centralized server. It's not cool!

### Key features of DappReader:
Multiple ways to easily add and manage all EVM chain smart contracts.

Quickly retrieve and manage published contracts


Quickly generate smart contract UI without code
